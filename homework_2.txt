Assignment 2 
Code used to add & commit mckeegan_assignment1 to GitHub

#First I made a new directory because this is going to be my repository
#It's called getgitty
$ mkdir getgitty
$ cd getgitty
#Then I initialized an empty repository in the getgitty directory
$ git init
###QUESTION: is there a way to make the directory and name the repo in one command?
#Like for instance, would typing git init getgitty just go ahead and make that?
#Anyway these were after thoughts...

#Then I moved my assignment from the directory it was in to where I was working
#I realize I could've done this before init
$ mv ../mckeegan_assignment1.txt .
#And finally made .txt file for this documentation
$ touch homework_2.txt
$ open homework_2.txt

#Anywhooo sorry now for the good stuff!
#Linking directory to GitHub
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/mckeegank/getgitty.git
#I did this after clicking around on my GitHub to make that repository...
#Could I have done that from the command line? I guess that's related to the question above
#Checking if it worked
$ git remote -v
#And now adding it
